#Authentication App with the MERN stack

I created a minimal full-stack login/authorization app using the MERN stack (MongoDB for database, Express and Node for backend and React for frontend)

This app allows users to:

- Register
- Log in
- Access protected pages only accessible to logged in users
- Stay logged in when they close the app or refresh the page
- Log out
